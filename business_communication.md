Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During my Term 4 Work Readiness training, I completed the *Business Communication* module, which focused on understanding how tone, language, and presentation affect professionalism in the workplace.

**Task:**  
My objective was to learn how to communicate appropriately in different professional situations — whether in emails, reports, presentations, or online meetings. This included understanding the difference between formal and informal tone, selecting the right language for different audiences, and maintaining professionalism when communicating digitally.

**Action:**  
I learned that:
A formal tone is polite, professional, and avoids slang. It uses correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.  
An informal tone is conversational and relaxed, used for casual communication with close colleagues or friends.  
I explored the key differences between formal and informal communication, such as:
Word choice: Formal language is precise and avoids slang.  
Grammar and punctuation: Formal writing avoids emoticons, exclamation marks, and all-caps text.  
The module also introduced professional online communication, where I learned that virtual presence matters as much as in-person etiquette. I practiced:
Maintaining eye contact by looking at the camera.  
Speaking clearly and avoiding distractions.  

**Result:**  
I gained a strong understanding of how to communicate effectively in professional environments — both in writing and online.  
This knowledge has strengthened my professionalism and prepared me for real-world workplace communication.

**Summary**
Through this module, I learned the importance of choosing the right tone and formality in workplace communication.  
I now understand when to use formal or informal language depending on the audience, situation, and company culture.  
This skill helps me write professional emails, speak confidently in meetings, and represent myself respectfully in any setting.
This knowledge has strengthened my professionalism and prepared me for real-world workplace communication.
