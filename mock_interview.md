## Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
As part of the Term 4 Work Readiness program, I participated in a mock interview exercise designed to simulate a real-life job interview experience. The purpose of this activity was to apply what I had learned from the *Interview Skills* module — including interview etiquette, tone, and confidence.

**Task:**  
My goal was to demonstrate professional behavior, communication skills, and interview readiness. I needed to prepare responses using the STAR method, present myself confidently, and show I could handle typical interview questions under pressure.

**Action:**  
I approached the mock interview as if it were a real job opportunity.  
Before the session, I:
- Reviewed my résumé and researched the role I was “applying” for.  
- Practiced answering behavioral questions using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).  
- Paid attention to my **tone, body language, and posture**, ensuring I maintained eye contact and spoke clearly.  
- Dressed appropriately and arrived early to show punctuality and respect.  

During the interview, I focused on staying calm and confident. I applied active listening and responded thoughtfully to each question.  
Afterward, I received feedback from my lecturer on improving the depth of my answers and slowing down my speech when nervous.

**Result:**  
The mock interview experience was one of the most valuable parts of the Work Readiness program.  
It helped me identify my strengths — such as professionalism and clear communication — while also highlighting areas for improvement, like providing more specific examples when answering questions.  
Overall, I gained confidence, learned to think on my feet, and now feel much more prepared for real-world interviews.  

This experience showed me that **effective communication, preparation, and self-awareness are key to interview success**.

## Summary
Participating in the mock interview gave me practical experience applying what I learned about interview etiquette and communication.  
It helped me manage stress, think on my feet, and respond using the STAR method.  
I now feel more confident and prepared to handle real interview scenarios successfully.
