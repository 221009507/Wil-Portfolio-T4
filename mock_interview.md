## Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
As part of the Term 4 Work Readiness program, I participated in a mock interview exercise designed to simulate a real-life job interview experience. The purpose of this activity was to apply what I had learned from the Interview Skills module including interview etiquette, tone, and confidence.

**Task:**  
My goal was to demonstrate professional behavior, communication skills, and interview readiness. I needed to prepare responses using the STAR method, present myself confidently, and show I could handle typical interview questions under pressure.

**Action:**  
I approached the mock interview video shoot as if it was a real job interview.  
Before the shoot I:  
- Paid attention to my tone, body language, and posture, ensuring I maintained eye contact and spoke clearly.  
- Dressed appropriately so that I look formal during the shooting of the mock interview video. 
- During the shooting of the interview I stayed calm and confident.

**Result:**  
The mock interview experience was one of the most valuable parts of the Work Readiness program.  
It helped me identify my strengths such as professionalism and clear communication while also highlighting areas for improvement, like providing more specific examples when answering questions.  

This experience showed me that effective communication, preparation, and self-awareness are key to interview success.

## Summary
Participating in the mock interview gave me practical experience applying what I learned about interview etiquette and communication. 
I now feel more confident and prepared to handle real interview scenarios successfully.
