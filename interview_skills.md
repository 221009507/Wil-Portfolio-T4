**Situation:**  
During the Term 4 Work Readiness program, I participated in lessons about Interview Skills and Etiquette. These sessions focused on how to prepare for interviews, present myself professionally, and communicate with confidence. 

**Task:**  
My goal was to understand how to apply professional interview etiquette, prepare for interview questions, and build confidence in presenting my strengths clearly. I also needed to learn strategies for both in-person and virtual interviews.

**Action:**  
From the lessons, I learned a few tips for future professional interviews:
- Arrive 10–15 minutes early and never be late.  
- Dress appropriately and maintain good personal hygiene.  
- Speak clearly and confidently, avoiding filler words or mumbling.  


For phone and video interviews, I learned to ensure good lighting, a plain background, and to look directly into the camera when speaking to appear confident and engaged.  

I also discovered a few key steps to prepare for any interview:
- Research the company, understand their mission, values, and the job role.  
- Know why I want the job, be able to explain why I want the job and what motivates me.  
- Know my achievements, problem-solving experiences.

These exercises helped me improve how I prepare for interviews.

Through this experience, I developed strong interview skills and learned how to prepare effectively for any type of interview.  
I can now present myself professionally, communicate my value clearly, and manage my nerves.  
Most importantly, I gained confidence in both my communication style and my ability to make a positive impression during job interviews.
