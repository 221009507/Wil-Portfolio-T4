## Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During the Work Readiness module, I participated in lessons on *Professional Networking* that highlighted the importance of building and maintaining real, ongoing relationships to advance one’s career. Before this activity, my understanding of networking was limited — I thought it only happened at formal events or through business cards. However, through the lesson, I learned that networking can happen anywhere, anytime, and with anyone.

**Task:**  
My task was to establish and maintain a professional online presence and begin building a personal network that would support my career growth. This included creating a LinkedIn profile, connecting with ICT professionals, and understanding how to communicate effectively and authentically in professional spaces.

**Action:**  
I began by creating and refining my **LinkedIn profile**, ensuring that it reflected my career goals, education, and skills in Application Development. I added a professional photo, a detailed summary, and listed my academic projects.  
Next, I started connecting with classmates, lecturers, and professionals in the ICT field. I joined online groups related to technology and software development to engage with relevant posts and discussions.  
Throughout this process, I applied the principles learned from the networking lessons:
- Building genuine, *mutually beneficial relationships* rather than collecting random contacts.
- Maintaining consistency by staying active online and engaging respectfully.
- Offering value to others by sharing posts, congratulating peers, and showing interest in their professional updates.
- Staying organized with my contacts and planning regular check-ins or interactions.

**Result:**  
By practicing networking both online and in person, I developed stronger **communication and relationship-building skills**. I realized that networking is not just about finding opportunities but also about **creating value for others**.  
I have built a small but growing professional network on LinkedIn that includes students, mentors, and ICT professionals. I also feel more confident introducing myself in professional settings, both virtually and face-to-face.  
Through this experience, I learned that networking is a continuous process that requires **authenticity, consistency, and a willingness to help others**. I plan to continue nurturing these relationships and expanding my network as I transition into my career.

**Key Takeaway:**  
> *“Networking isn’t just who you know — it’s about building meaningful, give-and-take relationships that help both you and others grow professionally.”*

## Summary
This topic taught me that networking is about building genuine, long-term professional relationships — not just collecting contacts.  
I learned how to connect with people both online and in person, maintain those connections, and offer mutual support.  
Networking allows me to gain insight, mentorship, and career opportunities through authentic relationships.
