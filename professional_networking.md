## Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During the Work Readiness module, I participated in lessons on Professional Networking that highlighted the importance of building and maintaining real, ongoing relationships to advance one’s career. Before this activity, my understanding of networking was limited I thought it only happened at formal events or through business cards. However, through the lesson, I learned that networking can happen anywhere, anytime, and with anyone.

**Task:**  
My task was to establish and maintain a professional online presence and begin building a personal network that would support my career growth. This included creating a LinkedIn profile, connecting with ICT professionals, and understanding how to communicate effectively and authentically in professional spaces.

**Action:**  
I began by creating a LinkedIn profile, ensuring that it reflected my career goals, education, and skills in Application Development. 
I will then start connecting with classmates, lecturers, and professionals in the ICT field. I am also considering joining online groups related to technology and software development for engagement.  
Throughout this process, I will apply the principles learnt from the networking lessons which are building genuine/mutually beneficial relationships and maintaining consistency by staying active online and engaging respectfully.

**Result:**  
By practicing networking both online and in person, I developed stronger communication and relationship-building skills, I realized that networking is not just about finding opportunities but also about creating value for others.  
I am building a small but growing professional network on LinkedIn that will includee students, mentors, and ICT professionals. 

## Summary
This topic taught me that networking is about building genuine, long-term professional relationships not just collecting contacts.  
I learned how to connect with people both online and in person, maintain those connections, and offer mutual support.  
Networking allows me to gain insight, mentorship, and career opportunities.
