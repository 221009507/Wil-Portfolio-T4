## Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During the *Work Readiness* module, I participated in a lesson focused on **Workplace Etiquette and Professionalism**. The session explained that professionalism is not about one’s title or position — it’s about behavior, attitude, and how one interacts with others.  
The topic taught me that professionalism is the *key to career success* and that acting respectfully, ethically, and appropriately builds trust and credibility in any work environment.

**Task:**  
My task was to understand and demonstrate the **do’s and don’ts of workplace behavior** — including how to communicate respectfully, manage time, behave in meetings, and present myself professionally both online and in person. I also had to identify how professionalism supports career growth and effective teamwork.

**Action:**  
To apply these lessons, I reflected on the different types of work environments — **office, remote, and hybrid** — and learned how to adapt my conduct to each.  
Here’s what I practiced:
- Dressing appropriately and presenting myself professionally during online meetings and presentations.  
- Being punctual and accountable by meeting deadlines and attending classes or meetings on time.  
- Showing respect and kindness toward others by listening actively, avoiding gossip, and communicating politely.  
- Practicing accountability by owning my mistakes and being open to feedback.  
- Maintaining ethical behavior by following rules, avoiding dishonesty, and using digital resources responsibly.  
- Applying the **5 Cs** of workplace success — Critical Thinking, Creative Thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Citizenship — in my daily interactions and teamwork.  

I also learned how to manage communication in **remote and hybrid environments** by:
- Keeping my camera on and dressing neatly for virtual meetings.  
- Communicating clearly and overcommunicating when necessary.  
- Respecting others’ time, space, and opinions, both online and in person.

**Result:**  
By applying these professional behaviors, I’ve grown more confident in how I present myself in formal and informal work settings. I now understand that professionalism is not only about appearance — it’s about **respect, accountability, ethics, and a positive attitude**.  
This knowledge will help me transition smoothly into the professional world and maintain a good reputation in my future ICT career.


## Summary
I learned that professionalism is the key to workplace success.  
This includes being respectful, accountable, ethical, and adaptable whether working remotely or in person.  
By practicing proper etiquette, positive communication, and reliability, I can contribute to a productive and professional work environment.
