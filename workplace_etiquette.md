## Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During the Work Readiness module, I participated in a lesson focused on Workplace Etiquette and Professionalism. The session explained that professionalism is not about one’s title or position it’s about behavior, attitude, and how one interacts with others.  

**Task:**  
My task was to understand and demonstrate the do’s and don’ts of workplace behavior including how to communicate respectfully, manage time, behave in meetings, and present myself professionally both online and in person. I also had to identify how professionalism supports career growth and effective teamwork.

**Action:**  
To apply these lessons, I reflected on the different types of work environments office, remote, and hybrid — and learned how to adapt my conduct to each.  
Here’s what I practiced:
- Being punctual and accountable by meeting deadlines and attending classes or meetings on time.   
- Practicing accountability by owning my mistakes and being open to feedback.  
- Maintaining ethical behavior by following rules, avoiding dishonesty, and using digital resources responsibly.  
- Applying the **5 Cs** of workplace success — Critical Thinking, Creative Thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Citizenship in my daily interactions and teamwork.  


**Result:**  
By applying these professional behaviors, I’ve grown more confident in how I present myself in formal and informal work settings. I now understand that professionalism is not only about appearance it’s about respect, accountability, ethics, and a positive attitude.  
This knowledge will help me transition smoothly into the professional world and maintain a good reputation in my future ICT career.
